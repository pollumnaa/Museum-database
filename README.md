# Museum-database

The database on the subject area "Museum" contains information about:
1. Branches: phone number, address and number of each branch
2. Events: event code, branch number, date, time and hall number
3. Exhibitions: exhibition code, exhibit code, name and age restrictions
4. Auctions: auction code, buyer code, lot code and its initial cost
5. Authors: the author's code, his full name, artistic style and phone number
6. Collectors: collector's code, full name and phone number
7. Exhibits: the author's code, the code of the exhibit and the material from which it is made
8. Collections: collection code, collector code, type of collection and its name

The entity and relationship model was created at the initial design stage.
The basic concepts of such a model are Essence, Relationship and Attribute.
The objects in the database are: "Branch", "Event", "Auction", "Exhibition", "Collector", "Author", "Exhibit", "Collection".
Attributes are properties of an entity or relationship.
For example, the attributes of the "Exhibition" object are: exhibition code, exhibit code, name and age restrictions.
The relationship between entities may look like this: "Exhibit" "Participates in" "Exhibition". 
A more detailed and accurate information is presented in the entity-relationship model.

The result of the work is a developed database. The database contains eight tables with test data and SQL queries.
